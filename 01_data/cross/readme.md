96 F2 and selfed offspring of the parents of a cross between *A.
thaliana* accessions 6191 and 6046. Pisupati et al. (2023; PLoS genetics 
19.5 : e1010728.) grew F2s from reciprocal crosses and selfed parents at 4°C
and 16°C and sequenced them using a protocol using oligo replacement and 
unmethylated dNTPS. These data are a subset of Pisupati's data resequenced
with the protocol using strand displacement and methylated dNTPs.    

I need to update this file with information on how to download the data once I 
have put them on a public server.
