# Columbia and fruit fly data

Raw sequence data from four samples of the *A thaliana*
reference strain Columbia (Col-0) and *Drosophila melanogater*. This is one
sample of DNA prepared using 13 or 15 PCR cycles, and relative
concentrations of transposase to DNA of 0.5 and 1. Nomimal coverage is 30x.

I need to update this file with information on how to download the data once I 
have put them on a public server.
