# Reference genomes

FASTA files of reference genomes:
* *A. thaliana* TAIR10 reference assembly.
* *D. melanogaster* genome (version 6)
* NEB lambda phage vector, used as an unmethylated control
* pUC19 vector, used as a methylated control
* *Lactobacillus acidophilus* and *Acetobacter aceti*, which apparently are
    common symbionts of fruit flies.

See download_genomes.sh for details of how to download the data.

For the vectors I downloaded these manually.
Lambda phage was downloaded from:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/J02459
pUC19 downloaded from
https://zymoresearch.eu/products/methylated-non-methylated-puc19-dna-set

Also included are text files giving the IDs of RdDM-targetted and CMT2-targetted
transposable elements in A. thaliana.
