# Align short reads to genomes

Align raw reads for Columbia (the A thaliana reference strain) and Drosophila
melanogaster to their respective reference genomes.

This is done with the bash script `bismark_pipeline.sh` which:
1. Trims reads with Trim Galore!
2. Checks the output with fastqc
3. Aligns reads with Bismark
4. Removes PCR duplicates and sorts the resulting BAM file
5. Creates a genome-wide cytosine report with Bismark's cytosine extractor.
