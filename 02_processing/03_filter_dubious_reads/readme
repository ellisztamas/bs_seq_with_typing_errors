Scripts to filter dubious reads from aligned BAM files.
Dubious reads are those on which every cytosine is methylated.

- 01_remove_dubious_reads.py is a Python script to sort reads.
- 02_remove_dubious_reads.sh applies this to each sample
- 03_cytosine_reports_columbia.sh and 04_cytosine_reports_drosophila.sh create
    cytosine report files for the filtered BAM files.

Not currently working - samtools complains that reads are not properly paired.
