Estimate a mean in the presence of typing errors

- `01_methylation_with_errors.R` defines functions to simulate a binomial
  process and estimate a mean in the presence of errors
- `02_simulate_methylation_over_loci.R` defines a function to simulate N loci
  with a given coverage and error-rate distribution, and calculate mean
  methylation in several ways.
- `03_run_simulations.R` applies the simulation function with various parameters.
- `04_plot_simulations.R` plots the results.
