Scripts to calculate overall methylation levels on each chromosome of the 
Columbia and Drosophila samples.

`01_conversion_rate.py` is a Python script to run this.
`02_conversion_rate.sh` is a BASH script to apply the function across samples.

For each sample this returns a CSV file listing:

1. Chromosome name,
2. Sequence context (this will be total methylation only, ignoring CG, CHG and CHH contexts),
3. Proportion of methylated reads across cytosines
4. Proportion of unmethylated reads across cytosines
5. Number of cytosines
6. Total number of reads
