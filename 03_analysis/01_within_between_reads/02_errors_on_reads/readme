Scripts to dissect reads from aligned BAM files to examine the distribution
of cytosine non-conversion within and between reads.

- 01_count_errors.py goes through each read in a SAM file and calculates the
    proportion of methylated cytosines, and bins each value into quantiles.
- 02_count_error_positions.py oes through each read in a SAM file and records
    at which positions non-converted cytosines are found.
- Scripts 03 to 05 apply the Python scripts to samples for the Arabidopsis
    reference strain, Drosophila, and the NEB Lambda phage.
- Scripts 6 and 7 plot the results.
